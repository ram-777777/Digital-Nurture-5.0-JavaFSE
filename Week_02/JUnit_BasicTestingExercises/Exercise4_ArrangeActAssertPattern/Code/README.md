## Exercise 4: Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) Pattern, Test Fixtures, Setup and Teardown Methods in JUnit

## Objective
Organize JUnit tests using the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern, and utilize setup and teardown methods to manage test state.

## What I did
1. Created a test class named `CalculatorTest` in the appropriate package.
2. Used the `@Before` annotation to define a `setUp()` method which initializes the `Calculator` object before each test.
3. Wrote a test method `testAddition()` that follows the AAA pattern:
    - **Arrange**: Performed in `@Before`
    - **Act**: Called the `add()` method on the `Calculator`
    - **Assert**: Used `assertEquals` to verify the result
4. Used the `@After` annotation to define a `tearDown()` method that resets the test environment by setting the object to null.
5. Ran the test and confirmed successful execution with setup and teardown messages.
